//Omni Converters can be used by any part that has a WBIOmniConverter part module. These are used in place of the traditional WBI template system configurations. The advantage is that a part can specialize its converters instead of being stuck with using one converter from a template and wasting the rest.

//Omni converter templates work almost like a ModuleResourceConverter in terms of setting them up except for the description field and TechRequired field. These provide a short description of the converter's purpose and the tech node that must be unlocked in order to use it.

//You can tag an omni converter template like you would a traditional template. If the converter's tags match the template's tags, then it can use the converter template.

//Just like storage templates, a converter's efficiency is standardized by volume: Assume that one converter takes up one cubic meter (1000 liters, about the size of a Bucboard 1000) unless otherwise noted. Parts should take this into account when determining how many omni converters the part has. 
//The volume of the converter affects its BaseEfficiency; a 1000-liter standard converter has a BaseEfficiency of 1.0, while a 500-liter converter has a BaseEfficiency of 0.5, and a 2000-liter converter has a BaseEfficiency of 2.0.
