# WBIPlaymodeUSI
KSP: dedicated playmode "USI" for WildBlueIndustries (MOLE, Pathfinder, ...)

# Design Considerations
* USI Life Support mechanism to be used; resources (supplies, fertilizer, mulch); LS recycler mechanics; habitation mechanics ()
   - https://github.com/UmbraSpaceIndustries/MKS/wiki/Life-Support
   - https://github.com/UmbraSpaceIndustries/MKS/wiki/Functions-(Habitation)   
* USI efficiency/load system to be used; crew skills impact; some parts acting as MKS efficiency parts 
   - https://github.com/UmbraSpaceIndustries/MKS/wiki/Crew-Skills-Impact-on-Parts
   - https://github.com/UmbraSpaceIndustries/MKS/wiki/Functions-(Efficiency-and-Load)
* USI resource conversions and manufacturing supply chains to be used
   - https://github.com/UmbraSpaceIndustries/MKS/wiki/Resources
   - https://github.com/UmbraSpaceIndustries/MKS/wiki/Functions-%28Manufacturing%29
* USI logistics system to be used; scavenging, distribution, surface/orbital logistics
   - https://github.com/UmbraSpaceIndustries/MKS/wiki/Functions-(Logistics)
   - TBD: side-by-side vs integration with vs replacement of WBI sharing/distribution system   
* General USI Balance guidelines to be used (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZI_0InZjd1tfrNDj8RWq45W6cg1UDm6BAkn2jB18Tsk/edit?usp=sharing)
